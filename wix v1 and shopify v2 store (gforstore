https://www.gforstore.com/ - Wix Version.
Backup project basically. 

A template for a non-code online store. Just a quick template because wix dosen´t solve my problem, i had to create this one just in case i change to shopify.
I´ve created a simple portfolio for me during my wix´s content learning and got a simple store with logo and a simple but emerssive and dynamic experience trought the portfolio.
There´s no products yet or plus intel about the store, because is just a example of how could be the store for you, my client.
So feel free to contact me if you need.
Check the link for more details.
